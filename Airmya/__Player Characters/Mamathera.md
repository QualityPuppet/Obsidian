Mam(athera) fell in love with a member of a magicratic family - a sorcerer - whilst on a job to kill one of her wife's family members
They fled to the south of Atenia to hide from her wife's family and had a daughter
Their daughter had an affinity for magic, so her and the wife were killed and the daughter stolen away
She was resurrected by a witch in the woods - "Nana", then went back to the organisation she used to work with - which sends her on the job as the part of the campaign

The wife's family are city nobles
