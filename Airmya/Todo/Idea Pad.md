## Setting
- Mechanised units
	- A country that relies on mechanical units
- Despite being general cunts, Dewbia and The Seat have angels in their military, though the angels refuse to partake in offensive wars against non-heretical/"evil" nations
- Technocratic feudal Japan?
- Belia being dragon riders, a sister state to Tian'Xe
	- Would finally make sense as to why the nations are tightly coupled, and why the culture of Belia is very metropolitan (who doesn't want to ride a fucking dragon?)
- We can rely on Athel to build out our religion, but loosen the couplings between the pantheons
	- Maybe have an official "Dewbian" pantheon and have every state have state religions that they care a lot less about
	- Do races want their own gods?
- Tilly and Aesllanan from the HE save
- Scarabs in Dezukhan Sultanate
