- Curse Maelstrom
	- The curse is actually an entity
	- Sometimes the entity can take over

Juniper is, and has always been cursed
She is part of a cult to try and bring an evil entity into the world
The leader of the cult has triplets, Juniper and her two sisters, and each one is cursed (up to DM what this manifests as)
She's raised by the cult to be a weapon, and they try and teach her to harness her curse
There is a Tian'Xe monastery that cleared out the cult, where she happily lived with an adoptive family and was blindfolded to mute her curse (the sisters had some other form of dampening applied), but they're not allowed outside so they're not dangerous to other people

Suddenly ~~Palpatine~~ the cult returned, slaughtered the monastery monks and kidnapped Juniper and her sisters once again to do cult things.

Her mother splits up the triplets to perform an ascension ritual
Juniper's was to be basically crucified under the sun, burning her eyes out in the desert (in the Dezukhan Sultanate?)
