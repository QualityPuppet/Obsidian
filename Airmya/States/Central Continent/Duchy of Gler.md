- Leader
	- [[Vurver]] - Head Overseer to the Glerran guilds
		- The Head Overseer is not allowed to participate in guild activities, and serves a much more administrative role than most heads of state, ensuring that no corners are cut and no laws are broken
		- Vurver himself is the 86th Head Overseer, and has proven to be incorruptible in his role, much to the chagrin of opportunistic traders and [[States/Central Continent/Ulban Empire|Ulban]] politicians
- Legislature
	- House of Guild Representatives
		- Each guild gets a certain amount of representatives, proportional to their output, which is a complex byzantine set of calculations and weightings measuring economic output and technological innovation, heavily influenced by both internal politicking and the politics of their sponsoring empire, the Ulban Empire
	- For the most part, the guilds are gnomish and descended from historical landed gentry, these days goblins and dwarves have established themselves, with their own styles of artificing providing unique benefits to the technological output, with the slow, methodical style of the dwarves massively improving their quality assurance and the hectic, chaotic style of goblin "testing" providing rapid iteration
	  There are also a couple of Elven guilds represented that are innovating in the magitech sphere, though it's difficult for Elven guilds to break into the market due to Elves' aloof nature, and harder still for them to navigate primarily gnomish politics
