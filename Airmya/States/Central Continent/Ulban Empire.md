	- [[Arin Aschenbrenner]][^1] - Emperor
		- The Ulbanian Emperor is the final word in Ulban politics
		- Arin Aschenbrenner is a young, charismatic man who started out as a prince of his local polity with high ambitions, even before taking the throne at age 18, the age dictated by Ulban law (at the time the provincial law of Aschenburg) he was putting plans in motions to unite the disparate Ulban kingdoms, and moved at frightening speed to unite the provinces together.
- Legislature
	- Feudal
		- Ulban politics, due to the speed at which the nascent nation came into being, is very fragile, with individual kings away from the influence of the capital still having a large amount of sway in the laws and legislation of their own provinces, and those close to the king either willingly or forcibly following the laws that the emperor and his administration decide to implement.
		- Somewhat paradoxically, there is a large amount of *de facto* devolution of powers as, while the emperor outwardly does not indulge in favouritism, kingdoms that tow the line often find that the enforcement of some of the laws the throne finds less important is left to the wayside, with the emperor's men "forgetting" about them.[^2]
- Culture
	- Ulbania is an empire comprising a number of previously independent kingdoms, united under the Aschen banner and, as a result, the Ulban culture is a mixed but related bag of cultures under a thin veneer of unity, with constant conspiracy and jockeying for position between the Ulban kings, avoiding the baleful gaze of an emperor who brooks no weakness in his polity.
	- Under Arin's stewardship, almost every minor kingdom on the central continent has been absorbed by the Ulban, with the border friction with the Protectorate of Crowden[^3] coming to the inevitable result of war.<br/>
	  This has put all of the surrounding kingdoms on edge, and degraded the historic relations of the Ulban Kingdoms with their neighbours, chiefly Atenia and the Vylkalian Republic.

[^1]: lit. "Ash Burner"
[^2]: The emperor is not a fool, and understands that trying to force homogeneity on the Ulban kingdoms would result in disloyal subjects, and the rate at which he unified the disparate kingdoms means that the state apparatus has a tenuous ability to control the empire, therefore he largely allows the Ulban kingdoms to manage themselves, retaining their own standing army, their own bureaucracy, as long as they pay the correct taxes and tithes.
[^3]: The Protectorate itself being a former Kingdom of the Ulban people, giving a strong casus belli to the emperor.
