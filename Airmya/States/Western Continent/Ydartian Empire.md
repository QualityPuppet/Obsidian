		- This is an insult used by the [[Tsardom of Sotyn|Sotyn]] people, referring to a common joke that the military hierarchy is so strict that if a Ydartian was given the order, they would do anything they're told

		- Emperor
		- The head of the Ydartian state is the commander of the Ydartian military forces, with jurisdiction over the infantry, magical, airborne and naval corps.
		  For the majority of Ydartian history, the seat of the emperor has been a position held by a person with unrivalled strategic, political and personal power, the ultimate personification of power, perhaps second only to [[Yue Xin]], the Moon Empress.
- Legislature
	- Meritocratic Stratocracy
		- Ydar is, by nature, both a meritocracy and a stratocracy.
		  The main prerequisite for a Ydartian politician is to be a successful member of the Ydartian Armed Forces, the path to becoming a regional politician has a minimum requirement of being a company commander.
		  Whilst it is possible to become involved in the operation of the government without enlisting, a Ydartian without experience in either combat or war will be limited to administrative positions
	- Ydar has always been in a compromised position, despite natural geography technically favouring them.
	  The [[Ulban Empire]] to the south, despite the fact that they do not have the military-first organisation that Ydar has, is both aggressive and expansionist, the [[Tsardom of Sotyn]] and [[Queendom of Merrin]] to the north are insular, but quick to rouse, Ydar has not always been as friendly with the [[Veloran Federation]] as they are now, and the [[Atenian Council]], whilst not overtly hostile, has historically caused no end of problems with their magical experimentation.
	  To add to the precarious local geopolitics, the [[Ydar-Anorian]]s that comprise the majority of the populace of Ydar, since time immemorial, has been plagued with a wide manner of foes, both bestial and magical.
	  All that has inexorably pushed Ydar towards a strong, cohesive military, and they brook no disunity within their ranks.
- Culture
	- As above, the Ydar have a strict military hierarchy, and their culture prides strength and cunning above all else.
	  Culturally they are strict, hierarchical, deviations from the norm are encouraged and celebrated if they serve the empire, but they have a legalistic culture, so deviations from the norm have to either follow the law, or be exceedingly well justified.
