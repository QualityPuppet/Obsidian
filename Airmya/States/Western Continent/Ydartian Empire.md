	- cucks (roughly translated from [[Tsardom of Sotyn|Tosyn]])
		- This is an insult used by the [[Tsardom of Sotyn|Sotyn]] people, referring to a common joke that the military hierarchy is so strict that if a Ydartian was given the order, they would do anything they're told

		- Emperor
		- The head of the Ydartian state is the commander of the Ydartian military forces, with jurisdiction over the infantry, magical, airborne and naval corps.<br/>
		  For the majority of Ydartian history, the seat of the emperor has been a position held by a person with unrivalled strategic, political and personal power, the ultimate personification of power, perhaps second only to [[Yue Xin]], the Moon Empress.
- Legislature
	- Meritocratic Stratocracy
		- Ydar is, by nature, both a meritocracy and a stratocracy.<br/>
		  The main prerequisite for a Ydartian politician is to be a successful member of the Ydartian Armed Forces, the path to becoming a regional politician has a minimum requirement of being a company commander.<br/>
		  Whilst it is possible to become involved in the operation of the government without enlisting, a Ydartian without experience in either combat or war will be limited to administrative positions
	- Ydar has always been in a compromised position, despite natural geography technically favouring them.<br/>
	  The [[Ulban Empire]] to the south, despite the fact that they do not have the military-first organisation that Ydar has, is both aggressive and expansionist, the [[Tsardom of Sotyn]] and [[Queendom of Merrin]] to the north are insular, but quick to rouse, Ydar has not always been as friendly with the [[Veloran Federation]] as they are now, and the [[Atenian Council]], whilst not overtly hostile, has historically caused no end of problems with their magical experimentation.<br/>
	  To add to the precarious local geopolitics, the Ydar-Anorians that comprise the majority of the populace of Ydar, since time immemorial, has been plagued with a wide manner of foes, both bestial and magical.<br/>
	  All that has inexorably pushed Ydar towards a strong, cohesive military, and they brook no disunity within their ranks.
- Culture
	- As above, the Ydar have a strict military hierarchy, and their culture prides strength and cunning above all else.<br/>
	  Culturally they are strict, hierarchical, deviations from the norm are encouraged and celebrated if they serve the empire, but they have a legalistic culture, so deviations from the norm have to either follow the law, or be exceedingly well justified.
