	- Dezukhan
	- Dezan
	- mana-drinkers (technically neutral, but those who use this will likely use it in a derogatory manner)
	- well men (derogatory, referring to the oasis')
		- This would be a particularly scathing insult to southern Dezans, as the wellsprings they subsist off are sacred to them, and reducing them to "wells" implies they are mundane
	- light drinkers
		- A Von Harsten play on words, playing on the fact that they spend their time in the sun (drinking up the sun) and the culture of the Dezan people (in particular the southern Dezans) and their reliance on their oases

- Leader
	- Ridha al-Hiyan - Caliph
		- The Caliph of the Dezukhan Sultanate is a ruler elected by and from a group of sultans who exercise control over their dominion by way of the Maridian Wellsprings, wellsprings imbued with the power of the Faydhaan, water elementals.
		- Ridha al-Hiyan is a capricious leader, prone to flights of whimsy.
		  He himself is not a leader, but a figurehead put in place after the last caliph died to avoid a civil war between the southern Dezukhans and the northern Dezukhans.
		  As of the moment, the north and the south function as autonomous kingdoms, each with a sultan overseeing their own Maridian, each largely ignoring the occasional demands of the Caliph, placating him with perfunctory gifts.
		  Given the neutering of the office, Ridha effectively functions as a PR tool for the sultans, being incredibly popular among the peasantry due to his whimsical nature and his tendency to simply give out gifts from the Maridian of Szazurjin, a wellspring of considerable power and depth.

- Culture
	- The Dezukhan's history is largely contextualised by their longstanding relationship with the Faydhaan[^1], who often frequent the cities of the Dezan, whilst the origin of the relationship is lost to the annals of time[^2], the Dezan worship the djinni in the same manner as the [[Tian'Xe|Ce'an]] might worship dragons.
	  Regardless of the exacts of Dezan history, the Dezan were granted the [[Maridian Wellsprings]], oases of magically imbued water, infused with the magic of the djinn.
	  The Maridian water is highly coveted, and rationed out to citizens in incredibly small quantities, when drank in its purest form it takes the smallest amount of Maridian water to hydrate a humanoid for a full day, even in the harsh summers of the Laqiya (Dezan name)/Hafur[^3] (foreign name, lit. "desert") desert.
- Interesting concepts to explore
	- The "Dezan litre" and currency
		- Due to the prevalence and importance of Maridian water, the currency of the Dezukhan Sultanate is not metal, as with most nations, but a standardised unit of Maridian water.
		  An informal rule among Dezans, usually when Meridian water is used outside of the non-standard unit, to avoid fraud traders will trade slightly more water than the agreed upon amount.
		  This is due to draconian fraud laws, most humanoids are able to intuit that Maridian water is magical, but due to the fact that water is fairly ubiquitous, trying to pass off normal water as Maridian water when being used as transactions is a heavily punishable offence
		  This also extends to situations outside fraud, but in that case it's considered blasphemy, although not *as* heavily punished due to the Faydhaan finding violence to be distasteful, especially on their behalf.

[^1]: The Dezan relationship with the Faydhaan has resulted in an interesting relationship with other elementals, as one might imagine this tends to follow the interactions of the elements

[^2]: The primary theory being that long ago, the progenitors of the modern day sultans asked for a wish from the Faydhaan to help them survive in the harsh conditions of the desert
