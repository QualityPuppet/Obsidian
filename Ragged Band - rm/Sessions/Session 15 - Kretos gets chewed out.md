Kretos chanced upon his cousin and ran away
He then prayed to Gorim, went back to his cousin and spoke to him
After getting Allie to interpret for him (idk how tf that works, given how autistic Allie is), he decided he needed to see his father
Allie told him that they were hunting down a forest troll before going, because she sure as shit wasn't going there to be bullied for hours on end by asshole minotaurs
She also gave him 40 minutes of shit about being a coward and yapped about how actions had consequences. This was partially projection.
