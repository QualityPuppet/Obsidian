We beat the lustspawn and broke the Apostle's control over ~~Gundahar~~ ~~Diegart~~ ~~Livegart~~ ~~Kretos~~ Korvax
Galadrius got knocked out and saw a couple of angels and got a boon from one.
Allie shot herself in the stomach to try and break the spell of the Apostle on her (which worked), and got knocked out and saw the angels and also Galadrius, the big scary male angel offered her a boon and didn't deliver.
Did res her to full tho.

They then met Yara and Edwin.
