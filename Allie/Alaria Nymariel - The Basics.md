Allie loves her wife. Out of four (five, counting the current) reincarnations spanning over two thousand years, this has been a constant. Allie's wife Anarella was her childhood friend in her second reincarnation, they grew up with each other, fell in love, and have been married across time and incarnations ever since.  
In each incarnation, whether they retain their memories or lose them, they still remember each other, in their last incarnation Allie was killed by a roaming dragon, and upon finding this out Ana decided very simply that she would kill herself.

Ana reincarnated as a Nymariel and, with full memories of her past life, preserved via ritual, she quickly established herself as a hyper-competent champion of the people.

It was not difficult for her to find Allie in this incarnation, not only was she royalty, but Allie was a noble in her own right, born to the Meko family, but unfortunately she wasn't subtle about her investigation.

When royalty turn up to your family home, trouble will invariably follow, and whilst Ana had successfully secured some limited support from her own family (not without effort, especially given that Allie was a complete unknown), her arrival came as a complete surprise to Ulrel Meko, the patriarch of the house.

Allie immediately knew what was happening, and took great efforts to restrain herself from simply running to her reincarnated wife (which was helped by her general icy demeanour), but it was still arduous process to negotiate, secure, and finalise the arrangement of the marriage.

It was an open secret that House Meko did dealings with the underworld, even if the sheer extent to which this delved wasn't obvious to anyone bar House Quel'anthir, Ulrel agreed to give that up in exchange for her marriage, something that would dissolve a significant chunk of their direct power in exchange for the soft power that came from a marriage to a noble house, and it took the negotiations many months to reach a conclusion that satisfied all parties involved.
