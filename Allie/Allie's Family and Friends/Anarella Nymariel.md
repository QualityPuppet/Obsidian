- Ana is Allie's wife :)
- A nephilim, half succubus, half elf, though after a few reincarnations she possesses mostly elven traits.
- Ana was reincarnated into House Nymariel after committing suicide in her previous life after Allie's death, because of this she was able to retain some of her memories of her past life, which streamlined the process of unlocking her sorcerous powers.  
- Which is good for her, because it's a pain in the ass figuring out she's a sorcerer every incarnation.
- Sovereign Wyrmblessed Sorcerer

- Due to the bloodline that she obtained in her first incarnation journeying with Allie, Ana has been reincarnated as a slime as a member of nobility twice, her last life being as a minor noble.

- Smoker
- When in public Ana is very outgoing and friendly, she often makes donations, hands out large tips, makes public speeches in support of popular causes, behind closed doors however, she's ambitious, driven, and ruthless

- She's not evil, and generally she tries to ensure that her impact is positive, but she is habitually manipulative
- Her political style is incredibly populist, and she often manipulates the narrative to place blame on her detractors, deliberately trapping them into a corner of public opinion
- She, like Allie, hates royal duties, and she spends much of her time managing internal and external affairs, an act that she finds much more enjoyable, leaving the paperwork to Allie

- Allie tries to avoid doing paperwork, often simply running off.  
    As a result, their aides usually get paid quite well for covering for her, to the chagrin of both Ulrel and Ana's parents who would appreciate them taking their duties more seriously

- This extends to Allie, though she doesn't really notice it and, even when she does, she doesn't particularly care

- Unlike most people, Ana does this less to get something out of her, and more because she's possessive
- It's worked for them over four incarnations, Allie considers it a good formula

- Allie reincarnated without her memories, so in this incarnation Ana is overprotective towards her

- Which is fair, without Ana's intervention Allie would have likely died/been assassinated several times in this incarnation, which has further solidified Ulrel's approval of her

- She is not fond of Allie's tendency to do absolutely nothing but work for weeks on end, and will actively employ underhanded tactics to break her attention

- Including but not limited to:

- Sleep spells
- A variety of potions
- "Requisitioning" her equipment
- Distracting her with a smaller, less time-consuming project
- In particularly extreme situations, yelling at her, though she prefers not to do so given it generally tends to result in Allie sulking and/or crying.  
    For several hours.

- She is also not fond of Allie's tendency to lose her projects, despite that fact that half the time it's her fault

- At one point Allie had spent about three months trying to duplicate magic weapons, which were lost during the ensuing argument.  
    How you lose enough magic weapons to supply a small militia is not something either of them can explain, but is still not on par with them managing to lose a few decades worth of memory potions between the two of them.
