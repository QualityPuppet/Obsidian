Ryko Meko didn't like this.  
He was Allie's senior by about three decades, the oldest unmarried member of the Meko household, Allie wasn't mature, being a decade shy of maturity by Elven standards, and, to his eyes, untrained in politics, his family had traded away their power for Allie's own whims.

His father had traded away their criminal business for a claim to royalty and political power, but the connections he'd made with the underworld didn't vanish, there was no retribution, save for a few particularly egregious offenders who'd flaunted their superiority over the enforcement branches of the elven houses, quietly taken as they travelled outside of their hideouts.

Ryko knew this, unlike Allie he had been there with his father at the negotiating table to listen and learn (another reason, to him, why the engagement should have been his to claim).

He knew the major players, shaken hands with them, and stole away in the night to organise the few direct reports he had.

After a few close calls with Quel'anthir, sneaking goods and people out from under their noses, and more than one tavern fight with a small player trying to take advantage of the ensuing power vacuum (and more than one of his bones broken), Ryko had established himself in the New Frenwall underground.

Despite the fact that he'd made a name for himself, and amassed a non-insignificant amount of power, he's been seething at his sister's perceived slight.
