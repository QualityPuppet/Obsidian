## Reincarnation 1

In this life she sequestered herself for several centuries researching the arcane, then realised that she'd obtained a lot of power and had very little time to actually do anything with it, so she decided to commit ritual suicide to reincarnate with her memories and start making an actual difference to the world[^1].
## Reincarnation 2
Allie spent most of the first century of her life honing her power within her new body
Around her eighth decade in this incarnation, Allie came across a criminal syndicate and set herself the task of dismantling it.

[[Anarella Nymariel]] (nee ???, as an orphan she didn't *have* a last name) was born, a new soul, as an urchin, she was brimming with magical power but had no outlet for it, which resulted in her swiftly being orphaned and kidnapped a decade before she came of age
Whilst taking out one of their larger slave rings, Allie came across Ana and set her free.

Ana's parents had been killed brutally, and she'd been kept under lock and key in awful conditions, trying her best to avoid invoking the wrath of her captors
Allie returned most of the freed slaves to a local township, but didn't really know what to do with the orphaned Allie, no family to help her and too close to coming of age for anyone to take her in (especially as a demonic nephilim), so she decided to keep her around, which led to a tragic comedy where, for about 6 months, Ana was scared of doing basically anything around Allie.  
After a while she realised Allie hadn't kidnapped or enslaved her, and she opened up and very quickly became attached to Allie
This initial was a source of endless irritation for Allie, who was set on her goal of "change the world" but still didn't understand the implications of doing so, nor had she obtained *any* social skills, until Ana managed to get herself kidnapped again[^2].

Ana, being half demon, eventually grew in power and ability, and started falling prey to her heritage, setting herself to the task of seducing Allie.
This generally tended to be very difficult, as most of the time Allie didn't realise what she was trying to do, and saw her more as a pet than a lover, and thus her efforts fell flat, until eventually Allie started doing in-depth research on demons, daemons, and devils, and after a while point blank asked Ana about it, and if she needed any help with her nephilim ancestry, much to Ana's surprise[^3].

Over the next few decades Ana put her best efforts into corrupting Allie, but found herself completely unable to genuinely harm her, finally realising that she wasn't fighting against her demonic heritage, but her Elven heritage.
Whilst she found herself unable to harm Allie, she did not have these qualms about other mortals, and judiciously applied her considerable skill in manipulation and deception to both her own ends and Allie's ends.

This left Allie reasonably confused, she did not understand why social interactions were now starting to go her way when she could previously turn a rewards ceremony into a diplomatic incident with alarming regularity
Unfortunately this eventually caught up to them, when they ended up on the wrong side of a high ranking noble with access to a considerably large court of mages due to about four different plans of Ana's falling apart in a domino effect
## Reincarnation 3

Allie and Ana, whilst going through the process of reincarnation, were picked up by a Shoki, who informed them that Ana was dangerously close to being condemned to hell  
Due to divine intervention, they were reincarnated in close proximity to one another, and soon started with their shenanigans
In this incarnation, however, both Ana and Allie were determined to take karmically good actions.
The problem was, Ana's moral compass was constantly fighting her demonic heritage, and Allie's moral compass was (and is)â€¦ questionable[^4]

Their first three centuries consisted purely of adventuring, with Ana learning how to be Elven, and Allie once again re-learning how to handle her magic
This process culminated with them curtailing a cult, saving a gold dragon from the cultists in the process, and earning Ana the blessing of said dragon (partially as thanks for freeing him, partially because she had had her arm removed without consent by a particularly swarthy demon in the process)
This is also the event that kick-started Allie hatred of demons[^5], knowing that da/emons and their ilk were capable of not only hurting her wife[^6], but permanently absorbing her soul.

After this, they retired from adventuring, with Ana using her skill at manipulation, politics, and her newfound sorcerous powers to help maneuver local politics to her advantage, which she then converted into assistance for lesser served members of the community (whilst keeping a small portion of the profits for herself), and Allie using almost fourteen centuries of knowledge to start inventing magic items to help the populace (again, with Ana turning a tidy profit off the ventures), whilst slowly condensing her most important memories into memory potions, usually producing a few redundant duplicates.
Within the next few centuries Allie and Ana ended up marrying[^7][^8], and soon after Allie and Ana passed on peacefully, committing ritual suicide at the age of 558.

## Reincarnation 4
In this incarnation, Allie managed to successfully lose all her memories, with the sole exception of Ana
She felt a distinct understanding that she was probably meant to be some form of mage, and promptly decided that the idea bored her, and if she'd really mastered magic then perhaps this time she should try something new, after all, for all she knew this could have been her tenth reincarnation, and whatever she did last time obviously didn't work, otherwise she'd still have her memories[^11]

In this incarnation, Allie decided to become a ranger, to Ana's immense confusion when she finally managed to leverage the connections she'd built over the past century as a daughter of a minor noble house to find Allie
Ana and Allie's time together was cut short quite quickly in this incarnation, as after about two and a half centuries together, Allie was fairly brutally dissected by a dragon, and upon learning this, Ana came to the logical conclusion that suicide was the only option, so as to not desync their ages.
## Reincarnation 5
After their [[Alaria Nymariel|marriage]], Ana and Allie had an in-depth talk.  
Soul eaters were now embedded in the world, and reincarnation was getting rather boring.  
When one of the two were to die, the other would simply commit suicide and they would both pass on, and if one's soul gets eaten, the other will make every effort into tracking down their soul gem and recovering them, and torturing the culprit[^9][^10].
 
Allie, once again, remained bereft of her memories from reincarnation four bar the memory of Ana[^12]
She currently lives a charmed life, despite her general demeanour she has a few people she cares for (a record, for her), in particular 
- A particularly [[Tomoe|exuberant guard lieutenant]] who insisted on being friends with her
- Two court staff (a mage, an alchemist)
- [[Darian Solwyn|A noble inventor]]
- One of her maids[^16][^17]

Despite all this, Allie has decided to take a journey for multiple reasons.
To begin, Ana, being of House Nymariel, and given their determination to pass to the afterlife at the conclusion of this iteration of Ana and Allie, wants to go out with a bang, and luckily for her she's in the *perfect* position to do so.
In order to achieve this, she believes she has to be perfect, a paragon of humility and justice, a champion of the people, and importantly, behind closed doors, absolutely and unabashedly **ruthless** in order to shield Allie from the public[^18].
Unfortunately for Allie, regardless of Ana's efforts she needs to have a minimum capacity for etiquette, social norms, and ability to host and interact with nobles, which has lead to a large amount of training for her that she cannot simply delegate to her aides.
As far as Allie is concerned, if it wasn't for her wife being by her side, this would be her own personal hell.
To follow, Allie, from the recounts of Ana, understands that in past lives she had more than a small amount of impact on the world.
She wishes to understand the impact that she had, she wants to explore the world

Ana, in this incarnation, is incredibly overprotective of Allie after her previous untimely death.
She was fairly manipulative towards Allie before, by virtue of her nature, but in this incarnation she's become borderline controlling for fear of losing her to a demon[^15].
With the help of absolutely no-one (because if anyone realised she was leaving for a secondment, she'd immediately have three layers of magical tracking put on her), Allie packed a bag with her stuff[^14] and an invention she'd been tinkering with, she left a letter on the desk and around 10pm, simply left.
She was only able to leave undetected by virtue of extreme luck, she'd accidentally picked the exact time a guard changeover was happening, and her wife was on a 3 day business trip[^13].
Unfortunately for quite literally every single person involved, she did not do that  
Scratch that, fortunately for Quel'anthir, who are banking on finding her first to gain a significant favour from Nymariel.

[^1]: Mythological levels of power and she uses it to be a hikikomori.
[^2]: Meteor swarm was probably an overkill spell for that situation, but que sera sera
[^3]: To be fair, if you're a demon of lust and someone who, on a surface level, seems to be devoid of meaningful emotion asks "oh would it make you happy if I shared my knowledge with you and we made out", you'd be surprised too
[^4]: She, as a general rule, is enthusiastic about being good, the problem is what *she* considers good and what classic morality thinks is good don't often align without issue.
[^5]: This is probably about the time the world wound was created, and Allie and Ana were most likely both engaged during their adventures actively trying to stop it.  
	Dealer's choice as to whether the dragon was related.
[^6]: At the time *very* long friends with benefits, though for absolutely ever intent and purpose they were in a committed relationship, and more than one succubus was taught the meaning of "cruel and unusual punishment" by Allie.
	Ana generally just threatened to vaporise Allie's suitors.
[^7]: Almost causing another diplomatic incident in the process after a noble attempted to force Allie into marriage, making Ana realise that maybe what she'd been feeling towards Allie for the past few centuries might, by mortal standards, be considered love, rather than lust, or greed, or her being happy to freeload of an incredibly gifted elf with absolutely zero social awareness.
	It was a whole thing lasting a fair few years and a lot of rather violent magic being slung behind closed doors.
[^8]: And you thought the average shonen anime was slow burn romance, take that Frieren, I've got you beaten by at least 3 centuries.
[^9]: Provided said culprit was da/emonic
[^10]: These bitches will literally choose suicide as the first and only option on a regular basis, I swear to Desna that if a dog was barking slightly too loudly in the neighbourhood regularly and they found it quite annoying "well, nothing to be done, Allie get the poison, bad RNG go next"
[^11]: She used a ritual designed for one person, but with two people.  
	In theory Ana has all of Allie's memories, she's just unable to access them.  
	Ana is blissfully unaware of this fact, and probably won't become aware without divine intervention, (and even if Ana found out she probably wouldn't tell Allie that. As much as she loves her, being her project for the next century sounds as enthralling as watching paint dry for a century, except she generally won't be mad at the paint for refusing to cuddle her because the paint thinks its research is more important)
[^12]: This time they weren't embedded in Ana's conscious, though the fourth and current incarnation still has incarnations 1 through 3 of Allie's buried in there somewhere
[^13]: If she'd simply asked someone to leave, they probably would have let her by arranging her wife's work trips in a way that she could accompany and explore, but at this point she's probably got about a minimum of a couple year's trust to build back up for that after her disappearing stunt
[^14]: Ana's Stuff
[^15]: Predictably, she is not taking Allie's month long absence well.
[^16]: Note: aides who get paid overtime for picking up her admin work
[^17]: Said maid is particularly concerned when engaging in any physical interaction with Allie, and avoids things like hugs.
	Luckily for her, that is fine with Allie.
[^18]: To her, if she can be visible in the eyes of the people, she can allow Allie to exist behind closed doors, in the shadows, meaning her dear wife can be relieved of that pressure to work on civic projects that help the people.
	In that way, she must be the face of her house, for Allie to be allowed to be the brains.
